    <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been like <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
      since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying 
      my time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
       Look at my most recent posts:
        <ul>
          <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
            <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].post_url %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
          <% } %>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <p>
      Talk soon,<br>
